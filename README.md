# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Repository containing my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in Clojure.

*Warning: Since I was learning Clojure at the time the code quality is in the lower end of the spectrum.*

- Days 1 - 6 the problems were simple and I was mostly getting used with the language and standard library.
- Day 7 was a difficult one. I decided to think of things from an entity and computed property perspective, used functions to do the computed property part (memoized them when necessary). Really liked this approach because it was easy to test and allowed me to solve the problems in small incremental steps. Also tried to solve it using DataScript but gave up once it got long and slow.
- Day 8 was an interesting one. I've managed to solve it with 273 lines of DataScript.
- Day 9 really cool problem, specially part 2. Used the entity and computed property like day 7, I really like how it simplify testing.
- Day 10 was ok, solved it by eagerly building new values.
- Day 11 tried to solve thinking about it as graph. First part was okay, second part became verbose and complex.
